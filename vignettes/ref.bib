abstract = {We study the long-term impact of climate change on economic activity across countries, using a stochastic growth model where productivity is affected by deviations of temperature and precipitation from their long-term moving average historical norms. Using a panel data set of 174 countries over the years 1960 to 2014, we find that per-capita real output growth is adversely affected by persistent changes in the temperature above or below its historical norm, but we do not obtain any statistically significant effects for changes in precipitation. We also show that the marginal effects of temperature shocks vary across climates and income groups. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04 °C per year, in the absence of mitigation policies, reduces world real GDP per capita by more than 7 percent by 2100. On the other hand, abiding by the Paris Agreement goals, thereby limiting the temperature increase to 0.01 °C per annum, reduces the loss substantially to about 1 percent. These effects vary significantly across countries depending on the pace of temperature increases and variability of climate conditions. The estimated losses would increase to 13 percent globally if country-specific variability of climate conditions were to rise commensurate with annual temperature increases of 0.04 °C.}

abstract = {We present a novel data set of subnational economic output, Gross Regional Product (GRP), for more than 1500 regions in 77 countries that allows us to empirically estimate historic climate impacts at different time scales. Employing annual panel models, long-difference regressions and cross-sectional regressions, we identify effects on productivity levels and productivity growth. We do not find evidence for permanent growth rate impacts but we find robust evidence that temperature affects productivity levels considerably. An increase in global mean surface temperature by about 3.5°C until the end of the century would reduce global output by 7–14% in 2100, with even higher damages in tropical and poor regions. Updating the DICE damage function with our estimates suggests that the social cost of carbon from temperature-induced productivity losses is on the order of 73–142$/tCO2 in 2020, rising to 92–181$/tCO2 in 2030. These numbers exclude non-market damages and damages from extreme weather events or sea-level rise.}

    abstract = "{This book is concerned with recent developments in time series and panel data techniques for the analysis of macroeconomic and financial data. It provides an account of the time series techniques dealing with univariate and multivariate time series models, as well as panel data models. It attempts at an integration of time series, multivariate analysis, and panel data models. It builds on previous research in the areas of time series and panel data analysis, particularly recent developments in the analysis of panels with a large time series dimension and covers a wide variety of topics. The book begins with an overview of basic econometric and statistical techniques, and provides an account of stochastic processes, univariate and multivariate time series, tests for unit roots, cointegration, impulse response analysis, autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models, simultaneous equation models, vector autoregressions, causality, forecasting, multivariate volatility models, panel data models, aggregation and global vector autoregressive models (GVAR). The techniques are illustrated using Microfit 5 with applications to economic variables like real output and inflation and financial variables like, interest rates, exchange rates, and stock prices.}",

abstract = {Summary This paper considers estimation and inference in linear panel regression models with lagged dependent variables and/or other weakly exogenous regressors when N (the cross-section dimension) is large relative to T (the time series dimension). It allows for fixed and time effects (FE-TE) and derives a general formula for the bias of the FE-TE estimator which generalizes the well-known Nickell bias formula derived for the pure autoregressive dynamic panel data models. It shows that in the presence of weakly exogenous regressors inference based on the FE-TE estimator will result in size distortions unless N/T is sufficiently small. To deal with the bias and size distortion of the FE-TE estimator the use of a half-panel jackknife FE-TE estimator is considered and its asymptotic distribution is derived. It is shown that the bias of the half-panel jackknife FE-TE estimator is of order T−2, and for valid inference it is only required that N/T3→0, as N,T→∞ jointly. Extension to unbalanced panel data models is also provided. The theoretical results are illustrated with Monte Carlo evidence. It is shown that the FE-TE estimator can suffer from large size distortions when N>T, with the half-panel jackknife FE-TE estimator showing little size distortions. The use of half-panel jackknife FE-TE estimator is illustrated with two empirical applications from the literature.},
